# Solana Yield Adapter Standard — Specification v1.0

## 1. Abstract

This document defines a standard interface for yield-bearing protocol adapters on Solana. The standard specifies three mandatory instructions, shared account structures, event definitions, and error codes that enable composable, auditable interaction with any yield source.

## 2. Motivation

Solana's DeFi ecosystem includes dozens of yield-bearing protocols, each with unique interfaces. This fragmentation creates:

- **Integration overhead**: Every aggregator must write bespoke code per protocol
- **User confusion**: No consistent way to view yield positions across protocols
- **Security risk**: Each custom integration is a potential attack surface

The Yield Adapter Standard solves this by defining a **minimal, universal interface** that any yield protocol can implement.

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Required Instructions

Every compliant adapter program MUST implement exactly three instructions:

#### `deposit`

```
Instruction: deposit
Args: amount (u64) — amount of underlying tokens to deposit
```

**Behavior**:
1. MUST validate `amount > 0`
2. MUST transfer `amount` of underlying tokens from the user to the adapter vault
3. MUST calculate receipt tokens proportional to the current share price
4. MUST update internal vault state (total_underlying, total_shares)
5. MUST emit a `DepositEvent`

#### `withdraw`

```
Instruction: withdraw
Args: amount (u64) — amount of receipt/share tokens to burn
```

**Behavior**:
1. MUST validate `amount > 0`
2. MUST validate the user has sufficient receipt token balance
3. MUST calculate underlying tokens proportional to the current share price
4. MUST transfer calculated underlying tokens from vault to user
5. MUST update internal vault state
6. MUST emit a `WithdrawEvent`

#### `current_value`

```
Instruction: current_value
Args: none
```

**Behavior**:
1. MUST resolve the calling user's position (receipt/share balance)
2. MUST compute `value = receipt_balance * total_underlying / total_shares` in underlying token units
3. MUST emit a `CurrentValueEvent` with that per-user `value`
4. MUST NOT reduce user receipt balances (read-only; optional yield accrual may update global vault NAV)

### 3.2 Share Price Calculation

The standard uses a **share-based vault model** where:

```
share_price = total_underlying * 1e9 / total_shares
shares_out  = deposit_amount * 1e9 / share_price
underlying_out = shares_burned * share_price / 1e9
```

The scaling factor of `1e9` provides sufficient precision for most token decimals.

**Initial deposit**: When `total_shares == 0`, the ratio is `1:1` (share_price = 1e9).

### 3.3 Required Accounts

#### Vault State

Each adapter MUST maintain a vault state PDA containing at minimum:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `authority` | `Pubkey` | Admin authority |
| `underlying_mint` | `Pubkey` | Mint of the underlying token |
| `total_underlying` | `u64` | Total underlying in vault |
| `total_shares` | `u64` | Total receipt tokens outstanding |
| `is_active` | `bool` | Whether the adapter is active |
| `bump` | `u8` | PDA bump seed |

#### Vault Authority

Each adapter MUST use a **PDA-derived authority** for vault token transfers. This ensures funds cannot be moved without program authorization.

### 3.4 Required Events

#### DepositEvent

```rust
#[event]
pub struct DepositEvent {
    pub user: Address,        // Depositor
    pub adapter: Address,     // Adapter program ID
    pub amount: u64,          // Underlying tokens deposited
    pub receipt_amount: u64,  // Receipt tokens received
    pub timestamp: i64,       // Unix timestamp
}
```

#### WithdrawEvent

```rust
#[event]
pub struct WithdrawEvent {
    pub user: Address,
    pub adapter: Address,
    pub amount: u64,          // Underlying tokens withdrawn
    pub receipt_burned: u64,  // Receipt tokens burned
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

#### CurrentValueEvent

```rust
#[event]
pub struct CurrentValueEvent {
    pub user: Address,
    pub adapter: Address,
    pub value: u64,           // User position value in underlying token units
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

### 3.5 Required Error Codes

Compliant adapters MUST use the following error code ranges:

| Range | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `6000–6099` | Standard adapter errors (defined in `yield-adapter-trait`) |
| `6100–6199` | Dispatcher errors |
| `6200–6299` | Registry errors |
| `7000+` | Protocol-specific adapter errors |

### 3.6 Adapter Metadata

Each adapter SHOULD publish an `AdapterMetadata` PDA containing:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `String[32]` | Human-readable name |
| `version` | `u8` | Adapter implementation version |
| `standard_version` | `u8` | Standard version (currently 1) |
| `underlying_mint` | `Pubkey` | Underlying token mint |
| `protocol_program_id` | `Pubkey` | Target protocol's program ID |
| `adapter_program_id` | `Pubkey` | This adapter's program ID |

## 4. Registry

Adapters are registered through the on-chain **Adapter Registry**:

1. **Propose** — Anyone can propose an adapter
2. **Approve** — Governance authority approves
3. **Revoke** — Governance authority revokes

The registry stores `AdapterEntry` PDAs indexed by adapter program ID.

## 5. Versioning

The standard version is tracked by the `standard_version` field in `AdapterMetadata`. Breaking changes to the interface require a new version number.

## 6. Security Requirements

- All arithmetic MUST use `checked_*` operations
- Vault authority MUST be a PDA (no external signers)
- All state-modifying instructions MUST emit events
- Adapter MUST validate token mint matches expected underlying
- Adapter MUST validate `is_active` before processing

## 7. Conformance

An adapter is **conformant** if it:

1. Implements all three required instructions
2. Emits all required events
3. Uses the standard error code ranges
4. Follows the share-based vault model
5. Uses PDA authority for vault transfers
6. Passes the conformance test suite
